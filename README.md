<h2 align = "center"> Hello there!ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p align = 'center'> I'm currently a Physics masters student at the University of Birmingham. I primarily write Python, <br> both as part of my degree and as a hobby. </p>
Over the past 2 years I have worked with the Quantum Technology Hub for Sensors & Timing at the university of Birmingham. During my time in this role I worked with C++ and the Qt library to develop an interface for controlling a compact atom trap for outreach and industry events. During my second internship with the department I repackaged the magneto-optical trap system to streamline it, developing fibre optics and cold atoms skills. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with a NodeMCU and learning Rust to make a macro pad!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make a control panel using JS, HTML and CSS.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, C++, Atomic Physics and Atom Trapping!
