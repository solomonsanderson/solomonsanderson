<h2 align = "center"> Hello there!ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p align = 'center'> I'm currently a 3rd year Physics undergraduate at the University of Birmingham. I primarily write Python, <br> both as part of my degree and as a hobby. </p>
Over the summer of 2022 I worked as a summer research intern for the Quantum Technology Hub at the University of Birmingham. During my time in this role I worked with C++ and the Qt library to develop an interface for controlling a compact atom trap for outreach and industry events. I also worked with arduinos and wrote scripts for them.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with an Arduino and FPGA to make a timing and control system for atom interferometer as part of my 3rd Year Group Studies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make a control panel using JS, HTML and CSS.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, C++, Atomic Physics and Atom Trapping!
